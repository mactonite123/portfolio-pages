        <p class="intro">What is a DAW?</p>
        <p>DAW or digital audio workstation is music recording software designed to help with creating a song from start to finish. DAWs normally come with software to mimic real world instruments such as drums and keyboards. Some DAWs come with little to no instruments built in. In this case, the composer would need to download plugins from external sources and load them into the DAW.</p>

          Getting Started

        <p class="intro">How to get started using a DAW</p>
        <p>The first thing you need to do is download a DAW. There are many paid versions and free versions available. The most widely used and respected DAW is Pro Tools which was release in 1989. However, there is a monthly subscription price of $31.99 to use the standard version.</p>
        <p>There are other free versions that have great features similar to Pro Tools. Cakewalk by BandLab offers many great features and is free to use. Cakewalk does not provide built in instruments but plugins called "virtual synths" can be downloaded from the internet and loaded into the DAW.</p>

          Basic Features
      </header>
        <p class="intro">What are the features of a DAW?</p>
        <p>DAWs let you lay out multiple tracks that record directly to a computer hard drive or other preferred destination. The recordings are generally stored as .wav files at high resolution to preserve the original quality. These .wav files can be manipulated and arranged in a timeline called a sequencer.</p>
        <p>Some of the terminology include; 
          <ul>
          <li><code>Quantize</code>, which will sync up the recorded notes to stay in even tempo. </li>
          <li><code>Loop</code> will allow repeating a section of recorded music to tempo. </li>
          <li><code>Send</code> will allow the track to be sent to another destination for effects processing.</li> 
          <li><code>Tracks</code> hold individual sounds which will let you process them individually. </li>
          <li><code>Save</code> will let you save the whole project to somewhere safe.</p></li>
          </ul>
